# Elm architecture using ramda and flyd
Elm architecture tutorial (https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial) implemented in javascript using [ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda) and [flyd](https://github.com/paldepind/flyd). React is used instead of a lighter vDom implementation just because I'm more comfortable with React.

This is just an experiment I did for myself. Figured it might be useful for somebody else as well.
As there are various ways to implement certain things (adts, render, etc) PRs and issues with ideas are very welcome.

To run the examples:
```
  cd Counter && node webpack-server.js

```
